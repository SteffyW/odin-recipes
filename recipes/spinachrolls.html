<h3>Vegetarian Spinach Rolls</h3>
<p>This spinach puff pastry snack is a vegetarian version of mini sausage rolls with a spinach and feta filling. I used frozen spinach because it was a better buy than fresh at the time but the equivalent amount of fresh spinach, chopped and wilted, would do the job.</p>
<br>
<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>1 (4 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese</li>
    <li>3 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in spinach and cook until warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes; season with salt and mix well. Transfer to a bowl; mix in feta cheese until combined.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.</li>
    <li>Lay 1 sheet of puff pastry on a lightly floured surface and cut in half lengthwise. Roll 1 half out with a rolling pin so it is wide enough to fold twice lengthwise. Mix egg and milk together in a small bowl.</li>
    <li>Spread 1/6 of the spinach mixture lengthwise in the center of puff pastry. Roll one side over the filling and brush other side with egg mixture. Roll over again to seal.</li>
    <li>Brush top of roll with egg mixture and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Cut roll into 6 equal-sized rolls. Repeat with the remaining puff pastry. Place cut rolls onto the prepared baking sheets.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until spinach rolls are puffed up and golden, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
